        "title": "Top 5 BEST Ethereum Mining Software [2021]",
        "excerpt":"There are many cryptocurrency mining software available for both Windows and Linux. However, some of them have better features, lower fees, or perform better on certain graphics cards.    Download Ethminer   Download now Download (mirror)   Today we will take a look at the TOP 5 mining programs that will be used in 2021 for AMD and Nvidia video cards.   Please note that the best miners may change over time as new updates and fixes are released, as well as new features.   Remember that all mentioned mining software and much more are available on our mining operating system - Hive OS   NBMiner   Nbminer   There is a large selection of Nvidia GPU miners right now. However, only a few of them stand out for their characteristics and stability.   Currently one of the best miners is Nbminer, which has been working hard to unlock LHR mode for Nvidia graphics cards.   Just a few days ago, a new version of Nbminer was released that allows the locked 30 series, also known as LHR, to increase hashrate up to 35% on some cards.   At the moment, we can observe that the hash rate of 3060 TI has increased from 30 to 40 MH/s. The 3070 TI can reach 50 MH/s, and the unlocked 3080 TI can reach 80 MH/s.   While this update doesn‚Äôt make Nvidia Locked graphics cards much better than before, we think it‚Äôs only a matter of time and additional updates when we see much higher hash rates for all of these graphics cards.   When choosing Nbminer, it is important to remember that this miner has a 1% development fee for mining Ethereum and is supported on all Linux and Windows versions. It can also mine other coins like ERGO, RVN or Beam, and several smaller ones.   üîç Check the Latest version of Nbminer        T-Rex   T-Rex miner   One of the best Nvidia miners is T-Rex because it was only built to support Nvidia graphics cards. It does not support AMD cards, but can be used with green graphics cards on Linux and Windows.   With a focus on Nvidia graphics cards, the T-Rex miner can provide the best hashrate on most cards like 1080 which can mine up to 35 MH/s and 1080 TI up to 48 MH/s.   If you have old Nvidia cards purchased before 2021, this is one of the best miners you can use.   It is only surpassed by Nbminer due to its LHR unlocking for newer models that include a hash rate limiter.   T-Rex can use over 30 algorithms, including popular ones like Kawpow, ERG, MTP, and has a 1% development fee, even on Ethash.   Now that we‚Äôve covered two of the best Nvidia card choices, let‚Äôs also show our love for AMD - the red cards.   üîç Check the Latest version of T-Rex miner        Teamredminer   Teamredminer   As the name suggests, Team Red Miner is a miner designed specifically for red cards, also known as AMD.   This miner will only work with these graphics cards, so if you have a mixed platform of green and red, the miner will not work.   Teamredminer is a very stable miner, consisting of many features, including exclusive unlocks for AMD VII or graphics cards that, when used correctly, can reach over 108 MH/s, which we have not yet seen with any other miner.   Teamredminer is also a highly optimized miner for Navi graphics cards such as the 5700 and 5700XT as it allows a much lower core voltage to be used in the overclocking panel while still having a high hash rate and low power consumption.   This miner also contains a very detailed guide on how to get the most out of your Vega graphics cards, another AMD card model optimized with this miner and not found in other miners.   Teamredminer has a development fee of 1% for ethash and 0.75% if you have Polaris cards like RX 580. It can also use other algorithms like Kawpow, lyra2rev3, MTP and many more.   üîç Check the Latest version of Teamredminer        Lolminer   lolminer   One of the reasons lolminer stands out is its ability to breathe new life into cards, as happened in late 2020 when 4GB cards were no longer mined.   drive Ethereum due to the size of the DAG file over 4 GB.   When this happened, around the Christmas season, developer lolminer released an update that allowed older graphics cards with insufficient memory to continue mining Ethereum at reduced hashing rates.   This allowed miners with 4GB cards to mine Ethereum for another four to five months, which brought a lot of coins to their wallets as mining profitability skyrocketed due to the high price of the cryptocurrency.   Another feature offered by lolminer is the ability to connect video cards even with 4GB of memory directly to the motherboard and let it run at almost full power, for example 30 MH/s in the case of the RX 470 series, RX 570 or RX 580.   This miner was also the first to unlock the first revision of the 3060 LHR graphics card, increasing the speed from 25 to 39 MH/s in Linux, without connecting the cards directly to the motherboard or the need to use an HDMI connector.   Lolminer has a 0.7% commission on Ethereum and can use other algorithms such as Cuckoo 29,31,32 and Autolokys.   üîç Check the Latest version of lolminer        Gminer   Gminer   Gminer is a very easy to use Windows compatible software that will allow you to mine cryptocurrency using your graphics card (GPU). The program allows you to mine several types of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum, Ravencoin, Aion, Beam or even Zclassic.   The miner is very easy to use and has a relatively clear interface.   üîç Check the Latest version of Gminer        All these miners were tested by us for a long period of time, were stable and worked without any problems. This is why, in our opinion, these are the best miners you can use to mine cryptocurrency in 2021.  ","categories": ["blog"],
