        "title": "Top 5 BEST Ethereum Mining Software [2021]",
        "excerpt":"There are many cryptocurrency mining software available for both Windows and Linux. However, some of them have better features, lower fees, or perform better on certain graphics cards.    Download Ethminer   Download now Download (mirror)   Today we will take a look at the TOP 5 mining programs that will be used in 2021 for AMD and Nvidia video cards.   Please note that the best miners may change over time as new updates and fixes are released, as well as new features.   Remember that all mentioned mining software and much more are available on our mining operating system - Hive OS   NBMiner   Nbminer   There is a large selection of Nvidia GPU miners right now. However, only a few of them stand out for their characteristics and stability.   Currently one of the best miners is Nbminer, which has been working hard to unlock LHR mode for Nvidia graphics cards.   Just a few days ago, a new version of Nbminer was released that allows the locked 30 series, also known as LHR, to increase hashrate up to 35% on some cards.   At the moment, we can observe that the hash rate of 3060 TI has increased from 30 to 40 MH/s. The 3070 TI can reach 50 MH/s, and the unlocked 3080 TI can reach 80 MH/s.   While this update doesn‚Äôt make Nvidia Locked graphics cards much better than before, we think it‚Äôs only a matter of time and additional updates when we see much higher hash rates for all of these graphics cards.   When choosing Nbminer, it is important to remember that this miner has a 1% development fee for mining Ethereum and is supported on all Linux and Windows versions. It can also mine other coins like ERGO, RVN or Beam, and several smaller ones.   üîç Check the Latest version of Nbminer        T-Rex   T-Rex miner   One of the best Nvidia miners is T-Rex because it was only built to support Nvidia graphics cards. It does not support AMD cards, but can be used with green graphics cards on Linux and Windows.   With a focus on Nvidia graphics cards, the T-Rex miner can provide the best hashrate on most cards like 1080 which can mine up to 35 MH/s and 1080 TI up to 48 MH/s.   If you have old Nvidia cards purchased before 2021, this is one of the best miners you can use.   It is only surpassed by Nbminer due to its LHR unlocking for newer models that include a hash rate limiter.   T-Rex can use over 30 algorithms, including popular ones like Kawpow, ERG, MTP, and has a 1% development fee, even on Ethash.   Now that we‚Äôve covered two of the best Nvidia card choices, let‚Äôs also show our love for AMD - the red cards.   üîç Check the Latest version of T-Rex miner        Teamredminer   Teamredminer   As the name suggests, Team Red Miner is a miner designed specifically for red cards, also known as AMD.   This miner will only work with these graphics cards, so if you have a mixed platform of green and red, the miner will not work.   Teamredminer is a very stable miner, consisting of many features, including exclusive unlocks for AMD VII or graphics cards that, when used correctly, can reach over 108 MH/s, which we have not yet seen with any other miner.   Teamredminer is also a highly optimized miner for Navi graphics cards such as the 5700 and 5700XT as it allows a much lower core voltage to be used in the overclocking panel while still having a high hash rate and low power consumption.   This miner also contains a very detailed guide on how to get the most out of your Vega graphics cards, another AMD card model optimized with this miner and not found in other miners.   Teamredminer has a development fee of 1% for ethash and 0.75% if you have Polaris cards like RX 580. It can also use other algorithms like Kawpow, lyra2rev3, MTP and many more.   üîç Check the Latest version of Teamredminer        Lolminer   lolminer   One of the reasons lolminer stands out is its ability to breathe new life into cards, as happened in late 2020 when 4GB cards were no longer mined.   drive Ethereum due to the size of the DAG file over 4 GB.   When this happened, around the Christmas season, developer lolminer released an update that allowed older graphics cards with insufficient memory to continue mining Ethereum at reduced hashing rates.   This allowed miners with 4GB cards to mine Ethereum for another four to five months, which brought a lot of coins to their wallets as mining profitability skyrocketed due to the high price of the cryptocurrency.   Another feature offered by lolminer is the ability to connect video cards even with 4GB of memory directly to the motherboard and let it run at almost full power, for example 30 MH/s in the case of the RX 470 series, RX 570 or RX 580.   This miner was also the first to unlock the first revision of the 3060 LHR graphics card, increasing the speed from 25 to 39 MH/s in Linux, without connecting the cards directly to the motherboard or the need to use an HDMI connector.   Lolminer has a 0.7% commission on Ethereum and can use other algorithms such as Cuckoo 29,31,32 and Autolokys.   üîç Check the Latest version of lolminer        Gminer   Gminer   Gminer is a very easy to use Windows compatible software that will allow you to mine cryptocurrency using your graphics card (GPU). The program allows you to mine several types of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum, Ravencoin, Aion, Beam or even Zclassic.   The miner is very easy to use and has a relatively clear interface.   üîç Check the Latest version of Gminer        All these miners were tested by us for a long period of time, were stable and worked without any problems. This is why, in our opinion, these are the best miners you can use to mine cryptocurrency in 2021.  ","categories": ["blog"],

        "title": "How to Install Ethminer on linux (Ubuntu) - Guide (2022)",
        "excerpt":"Simple steps on how to get started with ETHMiner by manually compiling it and configuring it for mining with Nanopool (although it will work for other pools as well).    Download   Download  for linux   While mining Ethereum on Windows is much easier, there is probably an improvement in hashrate when you are using Linux as a driver.   Commands and essence of this guide   First, make sure you have installed the latest AMDGPU-pro drivers with OpenCL support.  –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –¥—Ä–∞–π–≤–µ—Ä–∞.   AMD   sudo apt-get install opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd cmake git mesa-common-dev   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git cd ethminer git submodule update --init --recursive mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON cmake --build . -- -j sudo make install ethminer -G -M 0 ethminer -G --report-hr -P stratum1+tcp://0x47e83baffbc118393c082b7d4a62130b0480bb11.rigname@eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999   Nvidia   sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit cmake mesa-common-dev   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git cd ethminer git submodule update --init --recursive mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF cmake --build . -- -j sudo make install ethminer -U -M 0 ethminer -U --report-hr -P stratum1+tcp://0x47e83baffbc118393c082b7d4a62130b0480bb11.rigname@eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999   Requirements   Since Ethereum is optimized for GPU mining, one or more powerful GPUs are great. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs NVidia or AMD, although we prefer to use AMD.   Also make sure your graphics card has enough memory. You can use the DAG file size calculator, to find out how much memory you need. Video cards with less than 5GB of memory are no longer enough.   You will also need a wallet to provide your unique Ethereum address.   We personally recommend using Ledger, as it‚Äôs easy to set up, supports multiple currencies, and doesn‚Äôt consume all your system resources like Trust Wallet.   We don‚Äôt like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãresellers keeping your private keys, we suggest you stay away from cloud wallets.   For AMD cards, you also need to install the AMDGPU-pro driver with OpenCL support before compiling Ethminer.   Installing AMDGPU pro driver with OpenCL support   Get the latest drivers from the AMD support, page , then install them with  OpenCL support and reboot:   # See: https://www.amd.com/en/support tar -xf amdgpu-pro-*.tar.xz cd amdgpu-pro-*/ ./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=legacy,pal reboot   Vega10 (or newer) cards require change, replace legacy,pal with rocm:   ./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=rocm   Optionally, you can add --headless / or an --no-dkms option to the ./amdgpu-pro-install command if you don‚Äôt want AMD drivers loaded in the desktop environment:   ./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=legacy,pal --no-dkms --headless   Building Ethminer fot ubuntu   There is no need to manually collect Ethminer. The latest version can be downloaded from the releases page. However, if you are a professional and want to get additional hashes from your graphics card, compile the miner yourself by following the steps below.      First, install the necessary drivers for your video card:            For NVidia use:         sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit                       For AMD, first install the driver with OpenCL support and then use:         sudo apt-get install opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd                           Also make sure that all required packages exist on your system:     sudo apt-get install cmake mesa-common-dev git           Now download the latest version from GitHub into a new folder:     git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git cd ethminer git submodule update --init --recursive           Finally, compile it (the command will take a while, so be patient):            For AMD use:         mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON cmake --build . -- -j                       To use NVidia:         mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF cmake --build . -- -j                           Optionally, you can install it as an executable file:     sudo make install           First launch of Ethmienr   If you skipped step 5 above, you can start Ethminer from the ethminer directory inside the build directory you are probably still in:  ./ethminer/ethminer --help   Otherwise, you can run it directly:   ethminer --help   The commands above show brief Ethminer documentation. For lengthy documentation, use an --help-ext option with one of the valid extensions:   ethminer --help-ext   Optionally, you can view all options in the cpp-ethereum readme file  (which is the GPU-enabled ethminer source).   Benchmarking Ethminer   To get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Mh / s being achieved by your farm, you can run the test first. For ATI / OpenCL use:   ./ethminer/ethminer -G -M 0   For NVidia / CUDA use:   ./ethminer/ethminer -U -M 0   If the test returns an empty result (which it probably will be the first few times), wait for the DAG file to be generated.        Divide ‚ÄúMAX hashrate‚Äù by 1,000,000 to get the speed in megahashes. This is your real hash rate in MH/s.   Pool connection   Finally, we are ready to start mining! The last step is actually very simple, just run the following command:   ./ethminer/ethminer -G --report-hr -P stratum1+tcp://0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2.rigname@eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999   0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 - change the address of your Eth-wallet.   rigname - the name of your rig (or just remove it, as this is an optional option).   Mining should now start working. Optionally, you can track your progress by viewing your wallet address on the miner‚Äôs statistics page.   Ethminer supports all the latest protocols, allowing you to connect to any pool you want. See examples on how to connect to different pools to get started.   To understand if there is the best Ethereum mining pools, there are many factors that need to be considered that determine profitability.

The option has --benchmark-warmup been removed, so be patient and let the DAG file be generated.   Error - unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 8 are not supported   Build Ethminer fails. This error is actually self-explanatory and can be resolved by manually installing the gcc version:   First, remove all existing files from the current directory build:   make clean   Now install required libs and restart building:   sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8   For ATI/OpenCL use:   cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON .. cmake --build . -- -j   For Nvidia/CUDA use:   cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF .. cmake --build . -- -j   Ethminer does not see usable devices with AMD card.   Using clinfo, check if any platforms with OpenCL support are found:   # This is wrong Number of platforms                               0  # This is good Number of platforms                               1   Platform Name                                   AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing   Platform Vendor                                 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.   Platform Version                                OpenCL 2.1 AMD-APP (3143.9)   Platform Profile                                FULL_PROFILE [...]   If clinfo and ethminer does not see the devices, which means that you are using a device driver or not working properly, or does not support OpenCL. See above for how to install the driver for your device. Uninstall any existing drivers in advance. Optionally, you can check if the AMD driver is loaded into the kernel using:   lsmod | grep amdgpu   SIGSEGV, not enough memory available on device   –û—à–∏–±–∫–∞ SIGSEGV –æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –Ω–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–∏. A SIGSEGV error means there is not enough memory on the device.   Look at the lines above the trace message to figure out exactly what went wrong. If your device is low on memory, you can squeeze extra life out of your card by stopping all other programs and / or stopping the GUI / desktop environment.   Use the DAG Size Calculator to find out the minimum GPU memory required for mining.   Usage  ethminer --list-devices shows the amount of memory available.   An alternative solution would be to mine other coins that run on Ethash Proof of Work, such as Expanse or Metaverse.   Others (compatibility issues)   Sometimes, using the latest version leads to strange problems or bugs that have not been fixed yet. So you can check an earlier version (like v0.18.0) and try if it works:   git clone --single-branch --branch v0.18.0 https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git   Then follow the same assembly steps as above.   It is also important to check for conflicting drivers or other issues. For AMD, you can manually uninstall the existing drivers:   amdgpu-pro-uninstall rm -Rf /etc/vulkan /opt/amdgpu /opt/amdgpu-pro   Conclusion   After installing Linux with a prebuilt version of Ethminer, the hash rate jumped by almost 4 Mh / s. Therefore, we must conclude that the extra effort to get the miner and drivers up and running is really worth it.   Notification   Mining will shorten the lifespan of your hardware and force your computer to use more power, resulting in higher electricity bills. In addition, you can lose all the money you have invested. So, be careful!   You and you alone are responsible for any damage to you, your equipment, or financial loss.   Changelog   2019-01-11  -t 1 The flag is removed as it is not needed. Added a --report-hr flag to report hash to the pool. Changed the AMD drivers download page to ensure that users always get the latest driver.   2020-09-23 Added the -j ability to use all processor cores during assembly, because this significantly speeds up the process. Added documentation for the AMDGPU-pro driver farm with OpenCL support.   2020-09-24  Added additional troubleshooting information, low memory resolution and other minor fixes. Corrected version indication gcc, and g++ in the assembly.   2021-01-04  Maximum supported version gcc/g++ - 8, replaced by 6 in the bug fix.   2021-01-07  Added sudo before commands requiring additional privileges.
