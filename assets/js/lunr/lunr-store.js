        "title": "Top 5 BEST Ethereum Mining Software [2021]",
        "excerpt":"There are many cryptocurrency mining software available for both Windows and Linux. However, some of them have better features, lower fees, or perform better on certain graphics cards.    Download Ethminer   Download now Download (mirror)   Today we will take a look at the TOP 5 mining programs that will be used in 2021 for AMD and Nvidia video cards.   Please note that the best miners may change over time as new updates and fixes are released, as well as new features.   Remember that all mentioned mining software and much more are available on our mining operating system - Hive OS   NBMiner   Nbminer   There is a large selection of Nvidia GPU miners right now. However, only a few of them stand out for their characteristics and stability.   Currently one of the best miners is Nbminer, which has been working hard to unlock LHR mode for Nvidia graphics cards.   Just a few days ago, a new version of Nbminer was released that allows the locked 30 series, also known as LHR, to increase hashrate up to 35% on some cards.   At the moment, we can observe that the hash rate of 3060 TI has increased from 30 to 40 MH/s. The 3070 TI can reach 50 MH/s, and the unlocked 3080 TI can reach 80 MH/s.   While this update doesn’t make Nvidia Locked graphics cards much better than before, we think it’s only a matter of time and additional updates when we see much higher hash rates for all of these graphics cards.   When choosing Nbminer, it is important to remember that this miner has a 1% development fee for mining Ethereum and is supported on all Linux and Windows versions. It can also mine other coins like ERGO, RVN or Beam, and several smaller ones.   🔍 Check the Latest version of Nbminer        T-Rex   T-Rex miner   One of the best Nvidia miners is T-Rex because it was only built to support Nvidia graphics cards. It does not support AMD cards, but can be used with green graphics cards on Linux and Windows.   With a focus on Nvidia graphics cards, the T-Rex miner can provide the best hashrate on most cards like 1080 which can mine up to 35 MH/s and 1080 TI up to 48 MH/s.   If you have old Nvidia cards purchased before 2021, this is one of the best miners you can use.   It is only surpassed by Nbminer due to its LHR unlocking for newer models that include a hash rate limiter.   T-Rex can use over 30 algorithms, including popular ones like Kawpow, ERG, MTP, and has a 1% development fee, even on Ethash.   Now that we’ve covered two of the best Nvidia card choices, let’s also show our love for AMD - the red cards.   🔍 Check the Latest version of T-Rex miner        Teamredminer   Teamredminer   As the name suggests, Team Red Miner is a miner designed specifically for red cards, also known as AMD.   This miner will only work with these graphics cards, so if you have a mixed platform of green and red, the miner will not work.   Teamredminer is a very stable miner, consisting of many features, including exclusive unlocks for AMD VII or graphics cards that, when used correctly, can reach over 108 MH/s, which we have not yet seen with any other miner.   Teamredminer is also a highly optimized miner for Navi graphics cards such as the 5700 and 5700XT as it allows a much lower core voltage to be used in the overclocking panel while still having a high hash rate and low power consumption.   This miner also contains a very detailed guide on how to get the most out of your Vega graphics cards, another AMD card model optimized with this miner and not found in other miners.   Teamredminer has a development fee of 1% for ethash and 0.75% if you have Polaris cards like RX 580. It can also use other algorithms like Kawpow, lyra2rev3, MTP and many more.   🔍 Check the Latest version of Teamredminer        Lolminer   lolminer   One of the reasons lolminer stands out is its ability to breathe new life into cards, as happened in late 2020 when 4GB cards were no longer mined.   drive Ethereum due to the size of the DAG file over 4 GB.   When this happened, around the Christmas season, developer lolminer released an update that allowed older graphics cards with insufficient memory to continue mining Ethereum at reduced hashing rates.   This allowed miners with 4GB cards to mine Ethereum for another four to five months, which brought a lot of coins to their wallets as mining profitability skyrocketed due to the high price of the cryptocurrency.   Another feature offered by lolminer is the ability to connect video cards even with 4GB of memory directly to the motherboard and let it run at almost full power, for example 30 MH/s in the case of the RX 470 series, RX 570 or RX 580.   This miner was also the first to unlock the first revision of the 3060 LHR graphics card, increasing the speed from 25 to 39 MH/s in Linux, without connecting the cards directly to the motherboard or the need to use an HDMI connector.   Lolminer has a 0.7% commission on Ethereum and can use other algorithms such as Cuckoo 29,31,32 and Autolokys.   🔍 Check the Latest version of lolminer        Gminer   Gminer   Gminer is a very easy to use Windows compatible software that will allow you to mine cryptocurrency using your graphics card (GPU). The program allows you to mine several types of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum, Ravencoin, Aion, Beam or even Zclassic.   The miner is very easy to use and has a relatively clear interface.   🔍 Check the Latest version of Gminer        All these miners were tested by us for a long period of time, were stable and worked without any problems. This is why, in our opinion, these are the best miners you can use to mine cryptocurrency in 2021.  ","categories": ["blog"],

        "title": "ETHMiner - Настройка для Linux на примере Ubuntu",
        "excerpt":"В этом примере мы покажем простые шаги, как начать работу с ETHMiner, вручную скомпилировав его и настроив для майнинга с помощью Nanopool (хотя он будет работать и для других пулов).    Скачать   Скачать сейчас   Скачать (зеркало)   Хотя майнинг Ethereum в Windows намного проще, вероятно, есть улучшение хешрейта, когда вы используете Linux в качестве драйвера.   Команды и суть этого руководства   Сначала убедитесь, что вы установили последние версии драйверов AMDGPU-pro с поддержкой OpenCL.   AMD   sudo apt-get install opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd cmake git mesa-common-dev   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git cd ethminer git submodule update --init --recursive mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON cmake --build . -- -j sudo make install ethminer -G -M 0 ethminer -G --report-hr -P stratum1+tcp://0x47e83baffbc118393c082b7d4a62130b0480bb11.rigname@eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999   Nvidia   sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit cmake mesa-common-dev   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git cd ethminer git submodule update --init --recursive mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF cmake --build . -- -j sudo make install ethminer -U -M 0 ethminer -U --report-hr -P stratum1+tcp://0x47e83baffbc118393c082b7d4a62130b0480bb11.rigname@eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999   Требования   Поскольку Ethereum оптимизирован для майнинга на GPU, одна или несколько мощных видеокарт отлично подходят. Не имеет значения, NVidia это или AMD, хотя мы предпочитаем использовать AMD.   Также убедитесь, что у вашей видеокарты достаточно памяти. Вы можете использовать калькулятор размера DAG файла, чтобы узнать, сколько памяти вам нужно. Видеокарт с памятью менее 5Гб уже не хватает.   Также вам понадобится кошелек для предоставления вашего уникального Ethereum адреса.   Лично мы рекомендуем использовать Ledger, поскольку он прост в настройке, поддерживает множество валют и не потребляет все ресурсы вашей системы, как Trust Wallet.   Нам не нравится идея, когда посредники хранят ваши приватные ключи, мы предлагаю вам держаться подальше от облачных кошельков.   Для карт AMD вам также необходимо установить драйвер AMDGPU-pro с поддержкой OpenCL перед компиляцией Ethminer.   Установка драйвера AMDGPU pro с поддержкой OpenCL   Получите последние версии драйверов со страницы поддержки AMD, затем установите их с поддержкой OpenCL и перезагрузитесь:   # See: https://www.amd.com/en/support tar -xf amdgpu-pro-*.tar.xz cd amdgpu-pro-*/ ./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=legacy,pal reboot   Для карт Vega10 (или новее) требуется изменение, замените legacy,pal на rocm:   ./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=rocm   При желании, можно добавить --headless и / или --no-dkms опцию к ./amdgpu-pro-install команде, если не хотите, чтобы в окружении рабочего стола загружались драйверы AMD:   ./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=legacy,pal --no-dkms --headless   Сборка Ethminer для ubuntu   Собирать Ethminer вручную не требуется. Последнюю версию можно загрузить со страницы релизов. Однако, если вы профессионал и хотите получить дополнительные хэши от вашей видеокарты, скомпилируйте майнер самостоятельно, выполнив следующие шаги.      Сначала установите необходимые драйверы для вашей видеокарты:            Для NVidia используйте:         sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit                       Для AMD сначала установите драйвер с поддержкой OpenCL, а затем используйте:         sudo apt-get install opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd                           Также убедитесь, что в вашей системе существуют все необходимые пакеты:     sudo apt-get install cmake mesa-common-dev git           Теперь загрузите последнюю версию с GitHub в новую папку:     git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git cd ethminer git submodule update --init --recursive           Наконец, скомпилируйте его (команда займет некоторое время, так что наберитесь терпения):            Для AMD используйте:         mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON cmake --build . -- -j                       Для использования NVidia:         mkdir build; cd build cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF cmake --build . -- -j                           При желании вы можете установить его как исполняемый файл:     sudo make install           Первый запуск Ethmienr   Если вы пропустили шаг 5 выше, вы можете запустить Ethminer из каталога ethminer внутри каталога сборки, в котором вы, вероятно, все еще находитесь:  ./ethminer/ethminer --help   В противном случае вы можете запустить его напрямую:   ethminer --help   Команды выше показывают краткую документацию Ethminer. Для длинной документации используйте --help-ext опцию с одним из допустимых расширений:   ethminer --help-ext   При желании вы можете просмотреть все параметры в файле readme cpp-ethereum (который является источником ethminer с поддержкой GPU).   Бенчмаркинг Ethminer   Чтобы получить представление о Mh/s, достигаемых вашей фермой, вы можете сначала запустить тест. Для ATI / OpenCL используйте:   ./ethminer/ethminer -G -M 0   Для NVidia / CUDA используйте:   ./ethminer/ethminer -U -M 0   Если тест возвращает пустой результат (что, вероятно, будет в первые несколько раз), подождите, пока не будет сгенерирован DAG файл.        Разделите “MAX hashrate” на 1000000, чтобы получить скорость в мегахэшах. Это ваш реальный хешрейт в MH/s.   Подключение к пулу   Наконец, мы готовы начать майнинг! Последний шаг на самом деле очень прост, просто выполните следующую команду:   ./ethminer/ethminer -G --report-hr -P stratum1+tcp://0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2.rigname@eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999   0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 - замените адрес вашего Eth-кошелька.   rigname - название вашей фермы (или просто удалите его, так как это необязательная опция).   Теперь майнинг должен начать работать. При желании вы можете отслеживать свой прогресс, просмотрев адрес своего кошелька на странице статистики майнера.   Майнинг через другие пулы   Ethminer поддерживает все новейшие протоколы, что позволяет вам подключаться к любому пулу, который вы хотите.

Сборка Ethminer завершается с ошибкой #error – unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 8 are not supported! Эта ошибка на самом деле не требует пояснений, и ее можно решить, установив версию gcc вручную:   make clean   Now install required libs and restart building:   sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8   For ATI/OpenCL use:   cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON .. cmake --build . -- -j   For Nvidia/CUDA use:   cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF .. cmake --build . -- -j   Ethminer не видит пригодных для использования устройств с картой AMD Error: No usable mining devices found Используя clinfo, проверьте, найдены ли какие-либо платформы с поддержкой OpenCL:   # This is wrong Number of platforms                0 # This is good Number of platforms                1  Platform Name                  AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing  Platform Vendor                 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  Platform Version                OpenCL 2.1 AMD-APP (3143.9)  Platform Profile                FULL_PROFILE [...]   Если и то, clinfoи другое ethminerне видит устройств, это означает, что используемый вами драйвер устройства либо не работает должным образом, либо не поддерживает OpenCL. См. Выше, как установить драйвер для вашего устройства. Заранее удалите все существующие драйверы. При желании вы можете проверить, загружен ли драйвер AMD в ядро, используя lsmod | grep amdgpu. SIGSEGV, на устройстве недостаточно памяти Посмотрите на строки над сообщением трассировки, чтобы выяснить, что именно пошло не так. Если на вашем устройстве недостаточно памяти, вы можете выжать дополнительную жизнь из своей карты, остановив все другие программы и / или остановив среду графического интерфейса пользователя / рабочего стола. Используйте калькулятор размера DAG, чтобы узнать, какой минимальный объем памяти GPU необходим для процесса майнинга. Использование ethminer –list-devicesпоказывает доступный объем памяти. Альтернативным решением может быть добыча других монет, которые полагаются на Ethash Proof of Work, например Expanse или Metaverse. Другие (совместимость) проблемы Иногда использование последней версии приводит к возникновению странных проблем или ошибок, которые еще не исправлены. Поэтому вы можете проверить более раннюю версию (например, v0.18.0) и попробовать, работает ли она: git clone –single-branch –branch v0.18.0 https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git Затем выполните те же действия по сборке, которые указаны выше. Кроме того, важно проверить, нет ли конфликтующих драйверов или других проблем. Для AMD вы можете вручную удалить существующие драйверы: amdgpu-pro-uninstall rm -Rf /etc/vulkan /opt/amdgpu /opt/amdgpu-pro   Вывод  Когда я начинал работать с Windows 10, мой единственный R9 Nano достиг максимального хешрейта около 22 Mh/s. После установки Linux с предварительно созданной версией Ethminer хешрейт подскочил почти до 24 Mh/s. После ручного построения скорость в среднем составляет чуть более 25Mh/s, а если погода прохладная, то немного выше! Поэтому я должен заключить, что дополнительные усилия по запуску майнера и драйверов действительно того стоят. Считали этот пост полезным? Поддержите нас, отправив небольшую подсказку   Уведомление   Майнинг сократит срок службы вашего оборудования и заставит ваш компьютер потреблять больше энергии, что приведет к увеличению счета за электроэнергию. Кроме того, вы можете потерять все вложенные деньги. Итак, используйте свой мозг! Вы и только вы несете ответственность за любой ущерб, нанесенный вам, вашему оборудованию или финансовый ущерб.
